        <h2>Prologue â€” The Call</h2>
        <p>They came from different corners â€” a teacher, a farmer's son, a nurse, and a young musician â€” each carrying nothing more than a worn Bible, a small bag, and a fierce, gentle hope. The town they arrived in had a clay road, a market that sang at dawn, and an old mango tree that the children believed could grant courage.</p>

          <h2>First Light â€” Mansa's Lesson</h2>
          <p>On her first morning, Mansa sat with a group of children under the mango tree. She had a chalkboard but no chalk; she had a song in her heart but no instrument. The children taught her a game of measuring shadows to tell time. In return, she taught them a song about counting blessings.</p>
          <p class="quote">"A language you teach with your hands is remembered the same day the stomach is full." â€” Mansa</p>
          <p>By the end of the week, the small class had grown: mothers joined to learn a simple sewing stitch, and men came to borrow books. What started as a lesson became a circle of exchange â€” knowledge wrapped in hospitality.</p>

        <h2>Crossing Rivers â€” Jonah's Night</h2>
        <p>One night a storm rose. Jonah, the musician, kept vigil for a family whose house had flooded. With only a rope and two lamps, he guided the family across a swollen river, singing softly to keep spirits steady. The next morning, when the sun found them cold and safe, the mother pressed a single orange into his hand â€” a small, bright thanksgiving that tasted like the whole world.</p>
        <p>The true measure of the night wasn't the danger but the quiet way the town woke with a new story: "Jonah, who sang the river still."</p>

          <h2>Medicine and Mercy â€” Amina the Nurse</h2>
          <p>Amina set up a tiny clinic beneath a corrugated roof. She had bandages, a jar of sugar, and hands that folded like soft instruments. Between treating wounds and sharing laughter, she started a weekly circle where women learned about herbs, hygiene, and how to read the labels on tins. The clinic became more than cures; it was a place where people learned to be keepers of one another.</p>

        <h2>The Harvest â€” A Celebration</h2>
        <p>Months passed. Crops were tended, songs were taught, wounds were healed. The harvest came â€” not just of yams and millet, but of friendships and trust. They rolled out mats and lit lanterns; the band of neighbors and new friends shared food and stories. Children performed the shadow-game Mansa had taught them, and Jonah's song turned into a hymn the crowd hummed as they ate.</p>
        <p>That night, the missionaries sat with the village elders and felt, quietly, that the work they had come to do had come back to them tenfold in warmth and belonging.</p>

      <section class="scene">
        <h2>Epilogue â€” The Letter</h2>
        <p>Before they left, the town gathered to write a single letter. It was a patchwork of thanks, doodles, and names. The elders sealed it with a grin and the children pressed flowers between the pages. They handed the letter to the missionaries as a promise â€” a promise that the story would travel on.</p>
