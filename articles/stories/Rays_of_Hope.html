      <h2>The Call</h2>
      <p>When the small mission team from Grace Chapel set out for the remote mountains of Asuna, they had little more than faith and backpacks filled with medical supplies. The path was rugged, the air thin, and the language foreign. Yet every step felt like a response to something greater than themselves.</p>

      <p>Each day began before sunrise. The team prayed together under the misty dawn, then trekked to villages where few outsiders had ventured. Their laughter echoed through valleys once silent with despair. Children, once shy, began to follow them—curious, smiling, and filled with wonder.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        “We didn’t come to change them,” Sister Miriam wrote in her journal, “we came to listen, to love, and to learn how God was already working here.”
      </div>

      <h2>The Miracle</h2>
      <p>On the fourth week, a fierce storm trapped them in the hills. With dwindling food and soaked clothes, the villagers sheltered them, sharing the little they had. In that moment, the missionaries realized that true giving flows both ways. They had come to serve but were now being served with grace that words could not capture.</p>

      <p>By the end of their mission, a small school stood where an abandoned hut once leaned. Not grand or polished, but alive—with laughter, faith, and the first written words of children learning their names.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        “Love built the walls,” Brother Samuel said, “and hope opened the door.”
      </div>

      <p>The journey back was silent, not from exhaustion, but awe. They had seen God in faces dusty with earth, in songs sung under flickering lanterns, in hands that gave when they had nothing left to spare.</p>
