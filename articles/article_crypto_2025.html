In March, the agency demanded information from various companies as part of a review of aspects of Ether, the world’s second biggest cryptocurrency.
                        </p>
                        <p>Consensys is asking the court to rule that the token is not a security and isn’t under the authority of the SEC. Consensys is a software company founded by Joseph Lubin, who was also a co-founder of Ethereum blockchain. The firm focuses on building software products on Ethereum blockchain including digital wallet MetaMask. The SEC declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit supporting the blockchain, didn’t immediately return a request to comment. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said many digital assets are unregistered securities subject to SEC rules, but he has not specified if Ether is part of that group. Bitcoin, the world’s largest digital asset, is the only cryptocurrency that Gensler has definitively said isn’t a security in his view. The case is Consensys Software Inc. vs. SEC, 4:24-cv-00369, US District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). --With assistance from Muyao Shen.
