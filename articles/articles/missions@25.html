  <div class="opening">
    Missions 2025 did not begin on the mission field.  
    It began with people arriving quietly, bags in hand, hearts already leaning forward.
    By late afternoon, the engines started, prayers rose, and a journey was set in motion
    toward places waiting for hope.
  </div>

  <!-- NSADWIR -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">The Road to Nsadwir</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">Sunday night into the early hours</div>

    <p>
      When the convoy finally reached the Nsadwir mission ground at night, the air carried
      both fatigue and anticipation. A headcount confirmed that thirty-one had arrived,
      each assigned a space, each settling into the unfamiliar rhythm of the field.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was no rush to sleep. Leadership gathered, responsibilities were handed down,
      and with quiet authority the mission was declared open. By the time lights went out,
      something had already shifted.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">Before Dawn</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">Prayers, rules, and readiness</div>

    <p>
      Morning arrived early. Long before the sun, voices rose in prayer. Instructions were
      given, routines formed, and hearts aligned. The mission learned to move as one body.
    </p>

    <div class="moment">
      Orientation was not just about structure. It was about reminding everyone why they
      came: to speak, to listen, to believe, and to lead others toward belief.
    </div>

    <p>
      As evening approached, missionaries walked the community, praying street by street,
      name by name, ending the day physically tired and spiritually alert.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">Knocking on Doors</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">The gospel in living rooms and courtyards</div>

    <p>
      By the third day, the work moved from preparation to encounter. Doors opened.
      Conversations unfolded. Some listened quietly. Others wept. Some returned to faith
      they had left behind.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      By evening, nearly a hundred souls had been reached. Not as numbers,
      but as names and stories.
    </div>

    <p>
      That night, experiences were shared. Joy sat beside difficulty. Every testimony
      confirmed the same truth: the harvest was ready.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">When the Field Became an Altar</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">Crusade nights</div>

    <p>
      As the crusades began, the open grounds transformed. Worship filled the air,
      children gathered freely, and the Word was preached with clarity and conviction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each night carried its own grace. People responded. The sick were prayed for.
      Faith found expression in raised hands and quiet tears.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">Healing Beyond Words</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">Medicine and mercy</div>

    <p>
      One morning, chairs were arranged differently. Stethoscopes replaced microphones.
      The mission served bodies as faithfully as it served souls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Community members came steadily, some walking long distances. They were received,
      treated, counseled, and prayed with. Care was offered without condition.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">Water, Words, and New Life</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">The final day at Nsadwir</div>

    <p>
      Sunday arrived with quiet finality. Worship gave way to baptism. Lives publicly
      declared what had already begun within them. Others received fresh fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Goodbyes were spoken softly. Gratitude flowed freely. The mission did not end;
      it simply moved forward.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- KYIASE -->
  <div class="chapter">
    <div class="chapter-title">Meanwhile, at Kyiase</div>
    <div class="chapter-sub">Another field, same harvest</div>

    <p>
      While Nsadwir unfolded, another team labored at Kyiase. Similar rhythms formed:
      early prayers, long days, open-air worship, and steady growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Crusades drew families. Children came in numbers. The Word found deep roots.
      Medical outreach met practical needs. A church took clearer shape.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="closing">
    Missions 2025 closed not with exhaustion, but with fullness.
    Two fields. Many lives. One calling.
    What was planted will continue to grow.
